The projet is an Angry Birds style game in which the user can aim a cannon and shoot to structures trying to defeat targets.
For this iteration, the game was required to be built with Javascript, html5, css and also using a physics engine called Box2d.
The goal of this assignment is to apply the knowledge about Javascript and jquery as well as using different tools as the physics engine,
in order to achieve the goal of making a playable game.

## Synopsis
---------------
In this project, students were familiarized with the use of JSON and AJAX as well as loading and saving from a client to a server.
Also, JQuery, html5, and css were implemented in order to build a complete level editor page.
Draggables were used as well in order to edit the level in order to populate it with entities to be used in a future game.

# *** How to use ***
---------------------------------------

Splash Page:

- The splash page has only one purpose, selecting previously built levels in order to play them.

- Select a level by clicking on the second field and choosing from the dropdown list a level by name.

- Once the desired level is selected, by pressing the button the game area will be displayed.

For the game area:

- In this part the player can aim the cannon by clicking anywhere on the game screen (With the background as a grassland or sea)

- Once aimed, the player can press the shoot button located at the right side of the page.

- A ball will be shot from the cannon and the player will not be able to shoot until that cannonball disappears.

- The objective is defeating the target monsters to score and trying to get the highest score possible.

- Once all the targets are defeated, the player can shoot the remaining cannonballs as part of his or her victory.

- The player can return to level selection (splash page) by clicking the top button called "Level-Pick".

- After the game ends, a game over display will pop up showing the player's score.
